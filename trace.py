"""
A trace: a printed record of what your agent did, step by step, in order.

Right now, when your agent does something strange, your only evidence is the
final output. A trace turns that into a sequence you can point at.

You'll add trace calls to your loop in unit 4, Milestone 2. The formatting is
done for you here so you're not fighting alignment — what's yours is deciding
*where* the calls go, which is the part that makes the trace worth reading.

Use it like this, inside `run_agent()`:

    from trace import step, start_trace, get_trace

    start_trace()
    ...
    step("search_listings", inputs={"description": desc, "max_price": 30},
         returned=results)

At the end, `get_trace()` gives you the whole thing as text, ready to paste
into your README under **Loop Trace**.

Two things the rubric wants to see in it: every tool call in order, and the
MCP call visible among them. If you moved `search_listings` onto MCP, say so
in the step name — `search_listings (via MCP)` is enough.
